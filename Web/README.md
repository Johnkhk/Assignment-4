# Assignment 4 â€“ Get Some REST

We know that lab 3 has quite a few moving pieces, and while you are working in teams, we want to make sure that none of you miss out on the opportunity of getting practice with REST and Javascript. As a result, this assignment should be trivial, but also helpful!

We are simply asking you to individually submit the "User Management" (Part 1) portal of Lab 3 on your own.

This means that you will need to make sure the Docker container is running on your own machine and that we can duplicate what you are doing.

You and your team are free to architect the 3 pages (Sign Up, Sign In, and Admin Portal) however you like. You could use as much or as little Javascript to handle the interactions as you like.

Lastly, write a paragraph (inside a file named "Report.md") describing the decisions you and your team made in architecting this piece of your platform in **your own words**. This portion should be completely distinct from your labmates and should be emphasizing your understanding of how all the pieces fit together.

## Submission
To turn your assignment in, add your source files, your working database (the simple text file), and your paragraph in Report.md to this repository and push your changes to Github. Your TAs will also ask you to upload your repository to Gradescope.
