As a team, we decided to split the task into sign-in, sign-up, and admin-potal. I decided to primarily work on the the admin portal, which consisted of making the UI through HTML and CSS, as well as making interactive UX with JavaScript which lets the user change the status of users from void to verified or verified to void. As the sign-up and log-in were finished earlier, my groupmates were able to worrk on the backend and assist me in that aspect. We also decided to reach out to the TA's during lab hours and also during office hours which cleared up a lot of the confusion on how the backend data was moving around.
